In this document you can find some external references to broaden your horizon. These come in the form of YouTube videos, papers, tutorials etc. This will not be evaluated in the exam. We also give and indication of techniques being used within the department's research activies.
## AI use @MWMW:
* XR-lab: 
  - creation of virtual worlds to train a classification algorithm (image processing)
  - mapping 2D images to 3D worlds for virtual training
* SMAC unit:
  - Graph neural networks for classification of nodes in a network
  - NLP for content analysis
  - Image processing for content extraction and recognition
  - Predictive maintenance for navy ships based on sensor data
  - Medical planning and dispatching (application of search)
* Alice:
  - Convolutional neural networks image processing
