## Background information
### NLP advances:
* The original transformer paper "[Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)"
* ChatGPT and beyond [webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lnHHWRCDGk&list=WL&index=19&t=3s) from Stanford
* Build ChatGPT yourself,[a tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) by the legendary Andrej Karpathy (founding member of OpenAI, Sr. Director of AI at Tesla)


### ML in general:
* Google's [Lion optimizer](https://github.com/google/automl/tree/master/lion) as an alternative to ADAM
* Ari Seff's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/ariseffai) on AI (curruntly working at Google, formerly at Princeton)
* [DataFlowr](https://dataflowr.github.io/website/)'s modules to discover deep learning
