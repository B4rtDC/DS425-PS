# DS425

This page contains the support material for the practical sessions of the course DS425. 

Other related material for the course can be found on BelADL.

We will use Julia 1.5.3 (also on your CDN laptop) in combination with Pluto notebooks. You can check you are up-to-date with the dependencies by running the `config.jl` file which will updated on a regular basis. We use a specific virtual environment for this course (located in this folder). If you want to start the Pluto server, you can simply run `start.jl`.

In a terminal:
```
julia config.jl
julia start.jl
```
or within Julia:
```julia
include("config.jl")
include("start.jl")
```
