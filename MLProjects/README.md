# Projects page
You will work in groups of two. Each project can have two competing groups. Evaluation of your project is based on the following factors: inventiveness, creativity, method(s), performance, computational cost, analysis of advantages and disadvantages. Working on this project should lead to a deeper understanding of some methods and push you to learn more and develop additional skills.

You should provide a written report detailing: 
* the objective of your project
* a brief description of the data (i.e. your exploratory data analysis)
* the method(s) used and comparison of their results
* feature generation/extraction and the rationale behind it (if applicable)
* hyperparameter tuning (if applicable)
* conclusions

By the end of March, we should have finished all the required practical sessions. You can already start to work on your project as soon as you have made a choice by doing some exploratory data analysis or familiarizing yourself with the computation modules you will be using. Each contact hour on Fridays starting from March is planned for you to work on your project. 

Below you can find a list of datasets along with a brief description and possible applications. All of the datasets can be downloaded from BelADL.
* FACES: a collection black and white images of faces provided as jpg. Feature generation might be required e.g. gender-api.com to infer gender
    - classification (M/F/X, multiple methods possible)
    - clustering (multiple approaches possible)
* MUSIC: a collection of sound files for different genres provided as .wav files. Requires feature extraction/data manipulation (signal processing course & toolbox)
    - classification
    - recommender system (cf. Spotify)
    - identification of music (cf. Shazam)
* EMOTION: a collection of tweets combined with an emotion provided as a .csv file.
    - classification
* MOVIES: a collection of movie reviews combined with a binary label provided as .txt files in separate folders. 
    - classification
* MOVIES BIS: a collection of movie summaries with their genres provided as a .txt and .tsv file.
    - classification
    - clustering
    - recommender system (cf. Netflix)
* OBJECTS: a collection of images in 10 discrete categories, provided as a set of .mat files.
    - classification
* SENSORS: a collection of sensor readings (time series) in cars, provided as .txt file
    - classification
* FOOD: a collection of recipes provides as a .json or .csv file.
    - classification
    - recommender system (cf. UberEats)
* GLAUCOMA: a collection of images of eyes with or without glaucoma, provided as .jpg files in separate folders.
    - classification
